    <string name="testReview">I felt like this was a tremendous end to Nolan\'s Batman trilogy. The Dark Knight Rises may very well have been the weakest of all 3 films but when you\'re talking about a scale of this magnitude, it still makes this one of the best movies I\'ve seen in the past few years.\r\n\r\nI expected a little more _Batman_ than we got (especially with a runtime of 2:45) but while the story around the fall of Bruce Wayne and Gotham City was good I didn\'t find it amazing. This might be in fact, one of my only criticismsâ€”it was a long movie but still, maybe too short for the story I felt was really being told. I feel confident in saying this big of a story could have been split into two movies.\r\n\r\nThe acting, editing, pacing, soundtrack and overall theme were the same \'as-close-to-perfect\' as ever with any of Christopher Nolan\'s other films. Man does this guy know how to make a movie!\r\n\r\nYou don\'t have to be a Batman fan to enjoy these movies and I hope any of you who feel this way re-consider. These 3 movies are without a doubt in my mind, the finest display of comic mythology ever told on the big screen. They are damn near perfect.</string>
